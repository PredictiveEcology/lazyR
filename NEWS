Known issues: https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/lazyR/issues

version 0.0.10
==============
* Can now remove and list objects by md5hash (lazyLs and lazyRm)
* lazyLs return is now sorted by default by object name, but this is now an argument
which can be turned off. Previously, this was sorted alphabetically on the result, making
different orders depending on which archivistCol was used.

version 0.0.7
=============
* uses delayedAssign instead of makeLazyLoadDB, meaning the archivist package mechanism that saves rda files is sufficient.
* all conversions from old mechanism (with tools:::makeLazyLoadDB) to new mechanism (with delayedAssign) all implemented

version 0.0.2
=============
* initial release of lazyR
* documentation for all functions complete
* lazyR-package file for easy categorized view of functions
* deprecated setLazyDir and getLazyDir -> became lazyDir
* create assignCache and %<% assignment operator
* bug fixes
